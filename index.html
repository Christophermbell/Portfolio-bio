				<h1>Why I design?</h1>
				<br>
				<p>The reason I'm interested in developing software is that of many. Ever since I was in highschool and took classes in Graphic Media and Design I had an interest in learning to code beyond the graphic design I was learning at the time. Over the years I picked up books on learning to code at book stores and tried various methods online be wasn't able to find the time until now. I find coding and web design to be infinitly interested as theres a endless opportunities to pursue a career in the field or to use it as a valuble resource at home or on side projects. With the possiblity of the all different things you can make or do, it intrigues me. Another reason I love web design is the face that in a way it is art. You are building something of your own that many will see around the world and it's what you've created, it's your vision.</p>
				<br>
				<p>What I'd really like to do with the skills I'm learning is find a career in this field and give it everything I've got. I plan on developing a website for my own buisness that I've trying to get up and running. I'd eventually like to learn the languages that are used to made mobile applications and games, but that would be after I get a solid understanding in web developement of course.</p>
